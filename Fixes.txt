Silicon Erata

-Cut trace from ATmega-PD5 to nRF-CE. Reason: Thomas is a noob.
-Fly-wire from ATmega-PB5 to nRF-CE. Reason: Thomas is a noob.
-Cut trace from ATmega-SS to nRF-CSN. Reason: Thomas is a noob.
-Fly-wire from ATmega-PB6 to nRF-CSN. Reason: Thomas is a noob.
-Fix microUSB footprint to use cutout or via instead of plated splot (manufacturer cannot do plated slots).
-Swap 8-bit shift registers with higher current sinking/sourcing chip (min 20mA per pin, 160mA per chip).
-Replace SMA footprint to accomodate larger connector.
-Replace R2 10k resistor digikey part with correctly padded part.
-elongate shift register pads
-remove pads not-under the silkscreen on antenna
